Slide the Numbers Puzzle!
========================

Simple tile puzzle written on Python for Windows. Many of the existing tile games are written with extra packages like pygame, but I wanted to create a very simple script.

You will need the next packages:
- pandas
- os (comes by default intalled in most Windows systems)
- msvcrt (comes by default intalled in most Windows systems)

How to run this code:

- Download the file puzzle_slider.py
- Open a command prompt
- run "python puzzle_slider.py"
